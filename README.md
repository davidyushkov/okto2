Countries data: https://countriesnow.space/api/v0.1/countries
Cities data: https://countriesnow.space/api/v0.1/countries/population/cities

It's not the best, but API Ninjas data doesn't fit here, as to get all countries need to pay 40$
and user still get only one population data of one city for one request.
